If you're not careful and no-clip out of reality in wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, and endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you…

You've been here before.

Multiplayer is not recommended due to the  limitations Subworld Library. While it works, it make ruin some of the immersion.
